# Week 1 Progress Report

## Literature Review
- Started by reviewing the paper "It GAN Do Better: GAN-based Detection of Objects on Images with Varying Quality."
- Key takeaways:
  1. GAN-based methods can improve object detection robustness for low-quality images.
  2. Compared to fine-tuning methods, GANs enhance detection performance under distortions like blur and noise.
  
## Experiment Setup
- Set up the basic directory structure for the project (data, notebooks, models, results, etc.).
- Initialized the repository on GitHub.
- Added `.gitkeep` files to track empty directories.

## Challenges
- Limited time due to a short trip in the first week.
- Learning curve with GANs and computer vision concepts.

## Next Steps
- Continue literature review on GANs for anomaly detection.
- Implement basic object detection using pre-trained models.
- Experiment with generating synthetic data using GANs to tackle data scarcity.
